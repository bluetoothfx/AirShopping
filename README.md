# AirShopping
A very unconventional ordinary open source project &amp; dedicated to any living entity in this universe.

## Purpose of this project:
If you are a motivated person, want to manage a businees by yourself but you are lacking business communication
tools. Then this project is for you.

## How this will work for you:
This project will give you the power to look over your created business and create a channel between buyer & seller.
And you will be the middle man between them and maintain them. By maintaining this you may charge them and earn some money
because of your management. **There will be a lot of idea in future. But the current scope is limited to this cycle only.**

## Technical aspect
This project is truely unconventional & very loosely coupled intentionally. Though my background is business application developer
& I have worked with ERP based solution many years, I have a decent idea how things should design & work. But for this project I will
create it very conventional way & very loosely coupled way. Which might give any developer very funny/dumb feeling. I am saying this beause this is done intentionally :). Thanks for reading this through.

## Basic Idea (Who is who/what):
There will be three basic types of user. Like Admin, Buyer, Seller.
