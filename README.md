# AirShopping
A very unconventional ordinary open source project &amp; dedicated to any living entity in this universe.

## Purpose of this project:
If you are a motivated person, want to manage a businees by yourself but you are lacking business communication
tools. Then this project is for you.

## How this will work for you:
This project will give you the power to look over your created business and create a channel between buyer & seller.
And you will be the middle man between them and maintain them. By maintaining this you may charge them and earn some money
because of your management. **There will be a lot of idea in future. But the current scope is limited to this cycle only.**

## Technical aspect
This project is truely unconventional & very loosely coupled intentionally. Though my background is business application developer
& I have worked with ERP based solution many years, I have a decent idea how things should design & work. But for this project I will
create it very conventional way & very loosely coupled way. Which might give any developer very funny/dumb feeling. I am saying this beause this is done intentionally :). Thanks for reading this through.

## Basic Idea (Who is who/what):
There will be three basic types of user. Like Admin, Buyer, Seller.

> Admin (Owner of the platform):
* Can create market. 
* Can approve shop.
* Can see statistics.
* Can manage shop.
* Manage Shop Keepers & Buyers.

> Seller (Owner of the goods):
* Can create shop
* Can configure how shop will be displayed in the market
* Can receieve order
* Can see order history
* Can upload product

> Buyer (Who will search for products & buy):
* Can search for product
* Can create order
* Can check order status
* Can give remarks

# Technical aspects
The project will be very simple for end user to use. They will just follow few steps and the application
will be ready to serve them. But underlaying the technical base might not be that straight forward.

I will try to keep technical structure simple, as this will easy to host and serve.

> All the applications in this system will be **PWA** (First level Implementation)

##### Justification: If I made a native application I know there will be a lot of features I can give & lot of things I can use easily. But on the other hand when user will use/deploy this project then s/he needs to distribute this application via Google Play. This will be complicated for non-technical person or where Google play access is not available or where internet payment system is not good enough. Also there will be lots of same branded application in Google Play Store if in future people starts to adapt this project any how. But this things also can be handled in different ways if someday this project demands native application I will go on that way if things turn out like that. But for now I think PWA app will be great to start. Those who wants to make business just start our recommended installer and everything will be ready. Just go on certain link and distribute it any how. People will start using this application and our business owner will get statistics. 

> Currently the project is under research. I am looking for technical aspects & architecture how I need to build so that it has less complexity as well as easy to use in future.

##### Potential technical candidates:
> Vue Js, Kotlin, Java, .Net Core, Go, JavaScript, Express, Node JS, MongoDB, Redis, Postgresql, RethinkDB, GraphQL, Docker
> Though I am not familiar with some of the tech stack, I will select and learn what will be best for this project.

> Currently I am thinking about **VueJS**,**NodeJs**,**Express**,**MongoDB**,**Redis**,**.Net Core 3**,**JavaScript**, **Docker** as my technical stack.

> Check project status in Project board **https://github.com/bluetoothfx/AirShopping/projects/1#card-36164127**

#### Need to create wireframe & bring a conceptual design
> Soon will release a technical stack documentation so that we can focus this project technically.
